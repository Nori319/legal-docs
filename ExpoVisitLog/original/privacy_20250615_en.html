  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    This app (hereinafter “the Service”) is provided by an individual developer (hereinafter “the Developer”).  
    The Service respects users’ privacy and establishes the following policy (hereinafter “this Policy”) regarding the handling of personal information and related data.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information Collected and Purpose of Use</h2>
  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
    <tr><th>Information Collected</th><th>Purpose of Use</th></tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Firebase Anonymous User ID</td>
      <td>Providing app functionality (user identification)</td>

  <p>
    No personally identifiable information—such as name, email address, device information, or usage data—is collected.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Method of Obtaining Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Firebase Anonymous User ID is automatically obtained via anonymous authentication.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. External Transmission, Third-Party Provision, and Data Collection Modules</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>External Transmission:</strong>
      The app communicates with the Firebase Authentication server for authentication, receives the Anonymous User ID issued by the server, and uses it within the app. No other information (e.g., device information or usage data) is transmitted.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Third-Party Provision:</strong>
      No user-identifiable information is provided to any third party.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Data Collection Modules:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Firebase Authentication (Google LLC)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Management and Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    The Anonymous User ID used by the Service is issued and obtained from the Firebase Authentication server, and is properly managed to prevent external leakage.<br>
    Data entered by users within the app is stored only locally on the device and is never uploaded to any server.
  </p>

  <h2>6. User Control</h2>
  <p>
    The Service is designed for anonymous use and does not hold any personally identifiable information; therefore, requests for disclosure, correction, or deletion of personal data generally cannot be accommodated.  
    However, by using the “Logout” function within the app, you can delete the Anonymous User ID and all data stored locally on your device.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Policy may be updated as necessary. In the event of significant changes, notifications will be provided within the Service.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Contact Information</h2>
